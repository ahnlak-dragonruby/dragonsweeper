DragonSweeper
=============

This is an implementation of that classic game [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)),
built using the [DragonRuby Game Toolkit](https://dragonruby.org).

The aim of the game is to locate all the dragons hiding in the grid, without being enflamed by poking one unexpectedly.
